## About

This project consists of a registration form
of users divided into several steps. This form has four parts, in the first part the user informs the contact data, name, e-mail, password and password confirmation, in the second part academic data are informed, the university or school and the degree obtained, in the third part the user enters a text talking about him/herself, finally the registration is confirmed and the registered information is displayed, except the password. In each part of the form, fields are validated and error messages are displayed if any.

For this system, the React Form Hook and Yup library were used to control and validate the forms, React Router Dom for the routes and Tailwind Styled-Components and Tailwind CSS for the styles, in addition to using the Context API to manage the states.
